> **About:** The library that generates random numbers by 3 ways! Cryptographically strong Fortune? Fast XorShift+? Or maybe something mean? Fast and reliable Mersenne Twister? The choice is yours!

## Install

```sh
yarn add fortune-js
# or
npm install fortune-js
```

## Usage

```javascript
const random = require('fortune-js').default;
// or
import random from 'fortune-js';

// In reality, you will most likely need only one type generator
const Fortune = random('Fortune') // Or just random()
const MT = random('MT');
const XorShift = random('XorShift');

console.log(await Fortune.random()); // Prints a random number from 0 to 1
// To use await at the top level, you can use experiments.topLevelAwait in Webpack.
// If you still have not use Webpack, then just tell me why??
```

# Bonus

The library also provides the randomBytes function.
Pass the number with the desired byte number and you will get the Buffer with bytes generated by the Fortune algorithm.

```javascript
const randomBytes = require('fortune-js').randomBytes;
// or
import { randomBytes } from 'fortune-js';

console.log(await randomBytes(16)); // Prints a Buffer with 16 random bytes
```

## Wait... Async?! Really?!

Yes. Just yes. All random data generation functions are asynchronous.

The essence is that in browsers the library uses `Web Crypto API` (on the page with SSL).
This is a native crypto library, like `crypto` in Node.js.

If you want to use the synchronous version of the library, then look at version `1.x.x`.
But note that it is supported only in Node.js.

## Where does the library work? Everywhere.

Node.js and browsers use native versions of some internal functions, which allows the library work very quickly.
In any other environment that does not have a support for node.js Crypto, nor Web Crypto API will be used our implementations on pure JS.

## Types of generators

*How to choose the generator you need?*

**1.** If you need cryptographic strong random, fast work (in fact, all 3 algorithms are very fast),
then your choice is `Fortune` (this algorithm even uses by Apple since 2019).

**2.** If you need a faster job, with still a very random selection, you can use the `Mersenne Twister` (`MT`).

**3.** `XorShift` also shows even higher speed, but not recommended for use, since there are more interesting algorithms.

## API

`randomObj.random()` - generates a number between 0 and 1

`randomObj.randInt([limit])` - Generates an integer between 0 and `limit`

`randomObj.randFloat([limit])` - Generates a float number between 0 and `limit`

`randomObj.randRange([from], [to])` - Generates an integer between `from` and `to`

`randomObj.randFloatRange([from], [to])` - Generates a float number between `from` and `to`

`randomObj.select(array, [n])` - Select `n` unique (by index) `array` elements

`randomObj.shuffle(array, [copy])` - Shuffle the contents of the `array`.
If the `copy` is true, then the a new array is also created.
Otherwise, all operations will be performed on the source array (default).
